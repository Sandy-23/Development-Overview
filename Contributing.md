# Welcome to GreenStand

Slack is our main form of communications. Here are some Slack basics: 

To add a channel: on the left window in Slack find **channel +** and add yourself to relevent channels: #development, #android, #nodejs-api, #tree-talk etc..

* Speak out! Public messages build our team and keep us motivated. Use Public channels as much as possible. 
* Keep your messages in the relevant channels - talk about android in the android channel etc..
* Ask any question - we are friendly and all learning together. General tech questions go in #development, other questions in #general, android questions in #android etc.

## Basic Git Hub skills required!
If you have not heard of a **pull request** it is time for you to join over 27 million other developers and learn this version control platform. There are lots of cool articles to get you up to speed. https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
We use the Fork and Pull model. 
Basics: 
* Fork the repository
* All changes you make must be submitted for review via a pull request to the apropriate branch.
* Ask for clarification if needed (via Git pull requests or slack). 
* Report problems

Think Agile with small itterations and clearly defined commits.  When in doubt, ask.
